# Arithmetic Operators
# print("5+6= ", 5+6)
# print("5-6= ", 5-6)
# print("5*6= ", 5*6)
# print("15/6= ", 15/6)
# print("15//6= ", 15//6)
# print("15%6= ", 15%6)
# print("3**2= ", 3**2)

# Assignment Operators
# x=5
# print(x)
# x+=15
# print(x)
# x-=3
# print(x)
# x*=2
# print(x)
# x/=2
# print(x)
# x%=7
# print(x)

# Comparison Operators
# i=5
# print(i==5)
# print(i!=5)
# print(i>=5)
# print(i>5)
# print(i<=5)
# print(i<5)

# Logical Operators
# a=True
# b=False
# print(a and a)
# print(a or a)
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)
# print(b and b)
# print(b or b)

# Identity Operators
# a=True
# b=False
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)
# print(5 is 7)
# print(5 is not 7)
# print(5 is 5)
# print(5 is not 5)

# Membership Operator
# list1=[3,32,29,41,98,16,5]
# print(32 in list1)
# print(32 not in list1)
# print(4 in list1)
# print(4  not in list1)

# Bitwise Operators
# 0-in binary will be 00
# 1-in binary will be 01
# 2-in binary will be 10
# 3-in binary will be 11

# print(0 & 1)
# print(0 | 1)
# print(0 & 3)
# print(0 | 3)
# print(2 & 3)
# print(2 | 3)
